<p>At <a href="http://restlet.com" target="_blank">Restlet</a> we know about APIs. We provide tools for developers (and non-developers, too) to design, create, run and manage APIs that provide access to any data or application. </p> <p>We recently launched <a href="http://restlet.com/products/apispark/" target="_blank">APISpark</a>, an innovative self-service platform to deploy, manage and use web APIs in cloud mode. APISpark deeply relies on open source <a href="http://restlet.com/products/restlet-framework/" target="_blank">Restlet Framework</a>, first software for creating and using REST-style web APIs in Java. Restlet is also offering <a href="http://restlet.com/products/restlet-studio/" target="_blank">Restlet Studio</a>, a lightweight web-based development environment that accelerates the crafting and design of APIs.</p>
